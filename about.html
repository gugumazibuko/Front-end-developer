    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from [Johannesburg],[South Africa]</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
        <p>
            I am a young ,vibrant salesforce administration student ,with 5 years
            experience in hospitality as a cook and cleaner which helped hone my
            customer service and innovation skills,, hospitality also taught me how
            to work under pressure, multi-task andÂ patience. IÂ possessÂ knowledge of
            coding Â in HTML,CSSÂ  and basic web development and have an unmatched
            passion for the kitchen. I am reliable and always go the extra mile. My
            aspirations extend to achieving paramount excellence within my chosen
            sphere while nurturing a future generation of technologically empowered
            young women. I'm Primarily driven by the ambition of securing my
            family's well-being and possess a curious determination for learning and
            excelling in every opportunity presented to me.
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy learning new skills and experiences to enhance my knowledge. I
            have worked in hospitality for five years and after covid the industry changed decided to change my career.
            Being introduced to Shecodes was the best thing that's happened for me in a while 
            because I have always been fascinated by tech and how pages are built ,I am particularly enjoying 
            responsive because I finally get to learn and understand how to create multiple pages
            for a single website which is something I have been curious about since starting shecodes.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests include:learning new skills and recipes as I love being in the kitchen.
            The kitchen is my sanctuary,helps me clear my head and that is where I meditate.
            Also enjoy listening to gospel and 80s & 90s soul music as well as spending time with family and watching movies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although culinary is my first love, I strongly believe with practice & dedication 
            tech will be my second home because I live for a challenge and one of the reasons I love culinary
            that although there are standard basics to follow, you can let your creativity run wild in your creations
            and I believe tech does the same (it is a challenge that allows your imagination to flourish) and most
            importantly everyday offers something new to learn, provided you are willing.
